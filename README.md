Welcome to my Federated Learning project repository! In this repository, you'll find all the code and resources related to my implementation of a Federated Learning project.

Project Overview
Federated Learning is an innovative approach to machine learning that enables training models across decentralized devices or servers while keeping data localized. In this project, I've dived into the world of Federated Learning and applied its principles to solve a specific problem.
